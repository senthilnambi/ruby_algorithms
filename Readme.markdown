## Development

You will need these gems to get tests to pass:

  * rspec2
  * rake
  * SimpleCov (optional for coverage)

## Contributing

If you'd like to hack on Algorithm, follow these instructions. To get all of the dependencies, install the gem first.

  1. Fork the project to your own account
  1. Clone down your fork
  1. Create a thoughtfully named topic branch to contain your change
  1. Hack away
  1. Add tests and make sure everything still passes by running `rake`
  1. If you are adding new functionality, document it in README.md
  1. Do not change the version number, I will do that on my end
  1. If necessary, rebase your commits into logical chunks, without errors
  1. Push the branch up to GitHub
  1. Send a pull request for your branch

## Technology

This library was developed on a Macbook Pro. Software/methodology include:

  * iTerm2 ([link][1])
  * zsh ([zshrc][2])
  * MacVim ([.vimrc][3]/[.gvimrc][4])
  * ruby-1.9.3
